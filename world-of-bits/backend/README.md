# Backend Mock Server

Why do we need a server? One might argue that everything can be done in javascript. However, sometimes things are easier through the backend.

1. Integrate existing frontend components with minimal effort. 
2. Cache requests and create mock responses.
3. Allow rendering templates easily.
